# Keynote Slides Skill

**AI generates your infographics. You focus on the story.**

Slide tools force a choice: drag boxes in Keynote or wrestle with code in reveal.js. Neither lets you generate brand-perfect visuals on demand.

This skill flips that tradeoff. Single-file HTML decks with Gemini-powered infographics, multi-brand theming, and a Narrative Engine that matches your content to proven storytelling frameworks.

## 60-Second Start

```bash
# Create a deck
skills/keynote-slides/scripts/new-deck.sh my-pitch --entity northwind --title "Q1 Results"

# Preview it
skills/keynote-slides/scripts/serve-decks.sh
open http://localhost:8921/decks/my-pitch/index.html

# Generate visuals (press 'g' in browser, add your Gemini API key)
```

That's it. One HTML file. AI-generated infographics. Brand tokens applied automatically.

## What Makes This Different

| Traditional Slides | This Skill |
|-------------------|------------|
| Export to PNG, reimport | Generate infographics inline |
| One brand per template | Switch brands with `?entity=name` |
| 47 files per deck | One portable HTML file |
| Manual consistency checks | Automated layout + narrative review |
| Start from blank slide | Start from storytelling framework |

---

## The Workflow

```
Brief → Framework Match → Slide Generation → AI Visuals → Review Panel → Ship
```

### 1. Narrative Engine matches your content to structure

Answer five questions. Get framework recommendations with your content pre-mapped:

| Your Content | Framework |
|--------------|-----------|
| Surprise finding | The Prestige |
| Strategy roadmap | The Heist |
| Origin story | Hero's Journey |
| Root cause analysis | Columbo |
| Paradigm shift | Trojan Horse |

Narrative Engine references (including the selection guide and review checklists) are synced from [nraford7/Narrative-Engine](https://github.com/nraford7/Narrative-Engine).

### 2. AI generates brand-aware infographics

Add `data-gen` and `data-prompt` to any image. Press `g`. Gemini generates diagrams, charts, and visualizations that match your brand tokens.

```html
<img data-gen data-prompt="Flowchart: data pipeline from ingestion to dashboard.
     Use brand colors. Flat vector style. Labels 24pt+." />
```

Or use the `/acquire-images` skill which decides whether to **generate** (Gemini) or **search** (stock photos) for each slide:

| Content Type | Decision |
|--------------|----------|
| Diagrams, charts | Generate |
| Real people, places | Search (Unsplash/Pexels) |
| Branded hero images | Hybrid (search + AI overlay) |

### 3. Five-agent review panel challenges your deck

| Agent | Questions |
|-------|-----------|
| Audience Advocate | Does this land for your specific audience? |
| Comms Specialist | Is every headline tight and bulletproof? |
| Visual Designer | What visual makes the reveal unforgettable? |
| Critic | What's the weakest slide? Cut it. |
| Content Expert | Can every claim be defended? |

Optional **Stress Test Panel** pressure-tests with stakeholder personas (Engineer, Skeptic, CFO, Risk Officer, Lawyer, Conservative, COO) auto-selected by content type.

## Model-Mediated Architecture

**Model decides. Code executes.** Judgment lives in prompts; code only gathers
signals, runs tools, and writes artifacts.

What that means in practice:
- `scripts/narrative-build.js` prepares ingestion + prompt packets for the model.
- `scripts/review-all.js` emits analyzer signals (no severity); the model prioritizes.
- `scripts/deck-review.js` packages prompts for antagonistic agents.
- `scripts/model-mediated-conformance.js` validates required artifacts.

Artifacts you can audit:
- `resources/materials/ingestion.json`
- `resources/materials/narrative-build-prompts.json`
- `resources/materials/review-prompts.json`
- `resources/materials/analysis-summary.json`
- `resources/materials/work-runs/*.json`

If we keep heuristics temporarily, they are logged in `docs/model-mediated-deviation-register.md`.

## Brand System

One template. Multiple identities. Switch instantly.

```javascript
// decks/brands.js
northwind: {
  tokens: {
    '--brand-accent': '#ed8936',
    '--brand-ink': '#1a1a2e',
  },
  mediaPromptPrefix: 'Modern tech aesthetic, amber highlights...'
}
```

Switch brands:
- URL: `?entity=coastal`
- Slide: `data-entity="apex"`
- Generator panel dropdown

---

## Media Generation

### Browser (recommended)

1. Open deck → Press `g`
2. Save Gemini API key to localStorage
3. Click "Generate slide" or "Generate all"

### CLI

```bash
# Generate image with Gemini
python3 -m lib.media.model_mediated generate \
  "Network diagram showing microservices..." \
  decks/my-pitch/resources/assets/architecture.png \
  --brand "Modern tech aesthetic"

# Search stock photos
python3 -m lib.media.model_mediated search "team collaboration modern office"

# Download selected result
python3 -m lib.media.model_mediated download \
  "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-abc" \
  decks/my-pitch/resources/assets/team.jpg \
  --source unsplash --photographer "Jane Doe"

# Video (Veo)
python3 -m lib.media.generate video \
  --prompt "Data flowing through nodes, camera tracks left..." \
  --output decks/my-pitch/resources/assets/flow.mp4
```

### Prompt Structure

```
SIZE: 1600×900px (2× for retina)
LAYOUT: [Flowchart / Central Hub / Timeline / Split-Screen]
STYLE: Flat vector, brand hex codes only
TYPOGRAPHY: Headers 36pt+, labels 24pt+
CONTENT: [Detailed explanation, 3+ paragraphs]
KEY INSIGHT: [The one thing that must come through]
```

## Review Tools

```bash
# Layout issues (Playwright-based screenshot analysis)
node scripts/layout-review.js decks/my-pitch

# Narrative analysis (arc, flow, redundancy)
node scripts/narrative-review.js decks/my-pitch
```

## Copy Editor (sidecar)

Open a second window to edit copy without touching HTML.

```bash
# For existing decks (new-deck.sh now copies this file automatically)
cp skills/keynote-slides/assets/keynote-editor.html decks/my-pitch/editor.html

# Preview and edit
skills/keynote-slides/scripts/serve-decks.sh
open http://localhost:8921/decks/my-pitch/editor.html
```

In the editor window, click "Open deck" to connect the live preview. Edits are saved in localStorage; export JSON to hand off changes.

## Speaker Notes

Add notes per slide without affecting layout:

```html
<aside class="slide-notes">
  Speaker notes go here. Line breaks are preserved in the notes panel.
</aside>
```

Toggle the notes panel with the "Notes" button or press `n`. Add `?notes=1` to the deck URL to open notes by default. Use "Export notes" to download `speaker-notes-<deck-id>.md`.

## Animation + SVG

Use `data-anim` for lightweight animations (no JS libraries required):

```html
<h2 class="section-title" data-anim="slide-up" style="--anim-delay: 0.1s">
  The headline lands with motion
</h2>
```

Disable animation with `?motion=off` and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

SVG diagrams are first-class:

```html
<div class="media-frame" data-media="svg">
  <svg class="diagram" data-media="svg" viewBox="0 0 800 450" role="img" aria-label="Flow diagram">
    <!-- SVG markup -->
  </svg>
</div>
```

### Media lanes (avoid confusion)

- **Gemini**: only elements with `data-gen` (optionally `data-media="gemini"`).
- **SVG**: inline `<svg class="diagram" data-media="svg">` (no `data-gen`).
- **Static**: `<img src="...">` or `<video src="...">` without `data-gen`.
- **Animation**: `data-anim` only; it never implies media choice.

## Review Mode: How To

Collect feedback from reviewers directly on your slides.

### How do I enter review mode?

Three ways:
- Click the **Review** button in the bottom toolbar
- Press `r` on your keyboard
- Add `?review=1` to the deck URL

### How do I add comments to elements?

1. Enter review mode (elements highlight on hover)
2. Click any commentable element (titles, text blocks, cards, metrics, media)
3. First time only: enter your name and email
4. Type your feedback in the popover
5. Click **Add Comment**

A badge appears on elements with comments showing the count.

### How do I view all comments?

- Press `c` or click the sidebar toggle on the right edge
- Comments are grouped by slide
- Click **Go to slide** to jump to that element

### How do I mark feedback as resolved?

In the comment sidebar, click **Resolve** on any comment. Resolved comments fade out but remain visible. Click again to unresolve.

### How do I export feedback?

From the sidebar:
- **Export JSON** — machine-readable backup (`comments-<deck>.json`)
- **Export MD** — markdown summary for sharing or Claude iteration

### How do I review feedback outside the deck?

Open `skills/keynote-slides/assets/feedback-viewer.html`:
1. Load a `comments.json` file or paste a URL
2. Filter by open/resolved
3. Resolve, delete, or export comments
4. Pass `?url=<path>` to auto-load

### Where are comments stored?

Comments persist in browser localStorage keyed by deck ID. Export JSON to back up or share. The structure is backend-ready for future API integration.

## Troubleshooting

**Media won't generate:** Check `$GEMINI_API_KEY` is set. Verify in generator panel localStorage.

**Image search fails:** Set at least one of `$UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`, `$PEXELS_API_KEY`, or `$GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_KEY`.

**Colors wrong:** Use exact hex codes. Add "STRICT COLOR PALETTE" to prompt.

**Text illegible:** Generate at 2× display size. Specify "minimum 24pt text."

**Server won't start:** `lsof -i :8921` then `pkill -f "http.server 8921"`
